# pino-princess ðŸ‘¸ ðŸ’…

A pretty dev logger for pino and other ndjson.

Largely inspired from the great pino-colada project but with all the bells and whistles of pino-pretty.

## Features

- Works _just like_ [pino-pretty](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty)
- Awesome looking log lines out of the box
- All data is displayed with highlighting for _kick-ass_ readability
- ez to customize

## SAMPLES

> note: these samples are created by changing terminal colors - not by changing themes in pino-princess. However, pino-princess themes are entirely configurable so both ways of changing the colors are possible.

## Goals

[pino-pretty](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty) is hard to configure and I didn't like the defaults. However, it was very good at always showing me all my data. Unfortunately, I didn't care about seeing all the data. For example, most of the time, req/res headers are just noise for me during development.

[pino-colada](https://github.com/lrlna/pino-colada) was an awesome output format, but it was inflexible. I couldn't see all my data when I wanted to because of its rigidity.

In order to get the best of both worlds, I started from a fork of pino-pretty, and developed a configurable, pino-colada like log prettifier that always displays all your data, except when you don't want it to!

You could probably get something pretty similar with just an advanced pino-pretty configuration, but if you prefer lower configuration and easier to understand defaults, choose pino-princess.

### Install

`npm install pino-princess --save-dev`
or
`yarn install -D pino-princess`

## Usage

### CLI

The reccomended usage of pino-princess is as a separate process from your main application which pipes pino logs from stdout into pino-princess for formatting.

`node my-application-which-logs-with-pino.js | npx pino-princess --exclude "severity" --include "res.headers.ip, res.headers.x-my-important-header"`

### Pino v7 transport

pino-princess, as a fork of pino-pretty, is also set up to be used as a pino v7 transport. Please refer to the pino documentation to set this up.

## Configuration

pino-princess supports a simple configuration which can be supplied as either command line arguments, or alternatively, pino-princess.config.js file located in the path up from where the application is being ran.

### example

`pino-princess.config.js`

```js
/** @type {import('pino-princess').Configuration}*/
module.exports = {
  /**
   * exclude
   * string[]
   *
   * An array of strings which represent a key on any object.
   * Keys matching any one of these strings cause these keys to be excluded from the log output.
   * The excludes are always overridden by the includes.
   * In this way, excludes can be used to exclude large base objects and the "include"
   * can be used to pick certain fields and "add them back" to the log output.
   * For example, by default, pino-princess excludes the entire req or res object from any http logger.
   * Because some fields on req and res are required to constuct the core of the log line, these fields are added back via the include.
   *
   * default value:
   */
  exclude: ["req", "res"],

  /**
   * include
   * string[]
   *
   * An array of strings which represent a key on any object.
   * Keys matching any one of these strings cause these keys will ensure the key is always part of the log output.
   * The includes always overrides by the excludes.
   * In this way, include can be used to "add back" properties of excluded objects to the log output.
   * By default pino-princess includes all the properties required to create our standard log line.
   *
   * default value:
